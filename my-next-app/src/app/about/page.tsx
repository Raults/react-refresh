## About Me

I‚Äôm Ryan Tibbetts ‚Äî a frontend engineer with a soft spot for creative experiences and a history that spans both hemispheres.

I grew up as a military kid. Both my parents served in the U.S. Army and retired as Lieutenant Colonels. That lifestyle had me bouncing around: Kansas, Texas, Virginia, and Germany.  
By my teens, we landed more permanently in a small town called Tifton, Georgia.

I went on to attend Georgia State University in Atlanta, where I lived from 2012‚Äì2021. I started working remotely in 2019 ‚Äî a move that would become pivotal.  
After losing my job during COVID, I decided to lean into remote life.  
I retrofitted my Honda Element into a mobile home, packed my two cats, and spent the next year driving across the U.S. ‚Äî visiting national parks, family, friends, and festivals.

Eventually, I was invited by some friends at Meta to stay in California. That led to a contract at Google, where I built internal tools as a frontend engineer (Angular) on an incubator project.  
When the project sunset, I stayed. These days, I live in San Francisco with my wife and our four cats.

## Problem Solving is My Thing

I've built a web-based CAD interface using Three.js for OnScale (now owned by Ansys), wrangled Bazel-based monorepos using gRPC, HTTP/2, and Protocol Buffers at Google, and I tinker with game development in my free time.  
Limited but growing experience with Blender and Unreal Engine 5 helps keep the creativity sharp.
